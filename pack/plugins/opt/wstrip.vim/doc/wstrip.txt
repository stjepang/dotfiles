INTRO                                                            *wstrip-intro*

This plugin uses `git-diff` to strip whitespace from lines that you changed
while editing.  This allows you to keep newly added lines clean without
affecting the history of existing lines.

If the file is not in a `git` repository, `diff` is used to make a simple
comparison against the existing file on disk.

CONFIG                                                          *wstrip-config*

							       *g:wstrip_auto*
g:wstrip_auto			Enables automatic cleaning of trailing
				whitespace when a buffer is saved.

				Note: `b:wstrip_auto` can be used to enable
				this option per-buffer.

				Default: `0`

							  *g:wstrip_highlight*
g:wstrip_highlight		Enables highlighting of trailing whitespace.
				The `WStripTrailing` syntax group is used for
				highlighting.

				Note: If it appears Vim can display underlined
				text, the trailing whitespace will be
				highlighted with a red underline.  Otherwise,
				the trailing whitespace will be highlighted
				with a red background.

				Note: `b:wstrip_highlight` can be used to
				enable this option per-buffer.

				Default: `1`

						       *g:wstrip_trailing_max*
g:wstrip_trailing_max		The maximum amount of trailing whitespace that
				can exist before the remaining whitespace is
				stripped.

				Note: If highlighting is enabled, only the
				excess whitespace is highlighted.

				Note: This is set to `2` for the `markdown`
				|filetype|.

				Default: `0`
